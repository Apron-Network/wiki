# Service Ranking

The ranking rules are introduced into the Apron service marketplace, and services are automatically evaluated from multiple dimensions by inspector and Counselor. The current frequency of calls is the most major measure. If the current service node is called too few or too many times, its weight will be affected. When the number of calls is too much, the system will reduce its display times and display ranking. We hope that each service node can maintain a reasonable frequency of calls. When the service is unavailable, the service is excluded from the leaderboard. The ranking list is only a way to recommend infrastructure services to DApp developers. It is convenient for DApp developers to quickly find the infrastructure services they need in the market, and will not take them off the shelves or ban any infrastructure services.
