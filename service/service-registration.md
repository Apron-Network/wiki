# Service Registration

After connecting to the Apron Node, the infrastructure service provider can register all service information it can provide, including call mode, access address, fee description, permission and etc, to the Apron service marketplace through Apron Node. All service related information is recorded through the Apron service marketplace, and the service information is displayed to all developers and users through the front-end page. The information of any infrastructure service call will be put on the chain through the Apron Node.&#x20;
